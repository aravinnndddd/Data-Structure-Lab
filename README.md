This repository contains solutions for the Data Structure Lab as per the KTU syllabus. All programs and algorithms are implemented by Sreehari S J and follow he official KTU syllabus. Each folder contains:

- The C program for the respective lab exercise
- A detailed algorithm in `algorithm.md`


## Topics Covered

- [Stack Using Arrays](./Stack_Using_Arrays)
- [Queue Using Arrays](./Queue_Using_Arrays)
- [Circular Queue Using Arrays](./Circular_Queue_Using_Arrays)
- [Deque Using Arrays](./Deque_Using_Arrays)
- [Infix to Postfix Conversion](./Infix_to_Postfix_Conversion)
- [Postfix Evaluation](./Postfix_Evaluation)
- [Polynomial Addition](./Polynomial_Addition)
- [Sparse Matrix Operations](./Sparse_Matrix_Operations)

## Structure

- Each data structure or operation (Stack, Queue, Polynomial Addition, etc.) has its own folder.
- Both code and algorithm are provided for every topic.
