This repository contains solutions for the Data Structure Lab as per the KTU syllabus. All programs and algorithms are implemented by Sreehari S J and follow he official KTU syllabus. Each folder contains:

- The C program for the respective lab exercise
- A detailed algorithm in `algorithm.md`



## Topics Covered

- [Stack Using Arrays](./Stack%20Using%20Arrays)
- [Queue Using Arrays](./Queue%20Using%20Arrays)
- [Circular Queue Using Arrays](./Circular%20Queue%20Using%20Arrays)
- [Deque Using Arrays](./Deque%20Using%20Arrays)
- [Infix to Postfix Conversion](./Infix%20to%20Postfix%20Conversion)
- [Postfix Evaluation](./Postfix%20Evaluation)
- [Polynomial Addition](./Polynomial%20Addition)
- [Sparse Matrix Operations](./Sparse%20Matrix%20Operations)

## Structure

- Each data structure or operation (Stack, Queue, Polynomial Addition, etc.) has its own folder.
- Both code and algorithm are provided for every topic.
