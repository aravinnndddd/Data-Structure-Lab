# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Data Structure Lab (KTU) repository!

## Aim

This project aims to provide a complete, well-organized, and open-source resource for learning and mastering data structures as per the KTU syllabus. Contributions that help others learn, understand, and apply data structures are highly encouraged.

## Repository Structure

- **Lab Programs/**: Contains folders for each lab program (Stack, Queue, Polynomial Addition, etc.), each with C code and a detailed algorithm.
- **Resources/**: Contains subfolders for:
	- **notes/**: Detailed theory notes (e.g., trees.md, graphs.md, memory_allocation.md)
	- **cheatsheets/**: Quick reference guides (e.g., pointer_cheatsheet.md, sorting_cheatsheet.md)
	- **practice/**: Exercises, assignments, and test cases
	- **links/**: Curated external resources (e.g., gfg_links.md, youtube_links.md)
	- **visuals/**: Flowcharts, mindmaps, and presentations
