#  Stack vs Queue â€“ KTU Notes

---

## ðŸ”¹ Introduction
Both **Stack** and **Queue** are linear data structures, but they differ in how elements are inserted and removed.

- **Stack** â†’ Follows **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle.  
- **Queue** â†’ Follows **FIFO (First In, First Out)** principle.

## ðŸ”¹ Stack
### Definition
A **stack** is an ordered collection where insertion and deletion happen only at **one end** called the **top**.

### Operations
1. **push(x)** â†’ Insert element at top.  
2. **pop()** â†’ Remove element from top.  
3. **peek() / top()** â†’ Return top element without removing.  
4. **isEmpty() / isFull()** â†’ Check stack status.

### Representation
- Implemented using **arrays** or **linked lists**.  
- Time complexity:  
  - Push/Pop â†’ O(1)  
  - Search (in array) â†’ O(n)

### Applications
- Expression evaluation (infix â†’ postfix).  
- Function call management (recursion).  
- Undo/Redo operations.  
- Syntax checking (balanced parentheses).

## ðŸ”¹ Queue
### Definition
A **queue** is an ordered collection where insertion happens at the **rear** and deletion happens at the **front**.

### Operations
1. **enqueue(x)** â†’ Insert element at rear.  
2. **dequeue()** â†’ Remove element from front.  
3. **peek() / front()** â†’ Return element at front.  
4. **isEmpty() / isFull()** â†’ Check queue status.

### Variants
- **Circular Queue** â€“ Rear connects to front (efficient space use).  
- **Double-Ended Queue (Deque)** â€“ Insertion/deletion from both ends.  
- **Priority Queue** â€“ Elements removed based on priority, not arrival.  

### Applications
- Scheduling (CPU, disk, printers).  
- Buffers in IO devices.  
- Networking (packets, bandwidth management).  
- Breadth-first search (BFS) in graphs.

## ðŸ”¹ KTU Short Notes Points
- Stack â†’ LIFO; Queue â†’ FIFO.  
- Stack â†’ push/pop; Queue â†’ enqueue/dequeue.  
- Stack used in **recursion, parsing**.  
- Queue used in **scheduling, resource allocation**.  
- Both can be implemented using **arrays** or **linked lists**.
